Microsoft has a .sql file (KB878449_Capture_Logins.sql) that can be downloaded from their Microsoft Dynamics site which will backup all of the SQL logins, including passwords, for Microsoft SQL server 2000 through 2008. The script's output creates another script that you can use to restore the SQL logins with.

You must have an account to download the file.
