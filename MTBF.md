MTBF stands for Mean Time Between Failures. The Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a mechanical or electronic system, during normal system operation and can be calculated with the following formula: 

MTBF = (total_elapsed_time - sum_of_downtime)/number of failures
