GPT (GUID Partition Table) disks are not supported with the VMWare Converter, so you should always check and make sure that there are no GPT disks present before you convert a physical server. 

To check for GPT disks, run the following commands:

 c:\>diskpart
 
 Microsoft DiskPart version 5.2.3790.3959
 Copyright (C) 1999-2001 Microsoft Corporation.
 On computer: Server01
 
 DISKPART> list disk
  
  Disk ###  Status      Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
  --------  ----------  -------  -------  ---  ---
  Disk 0    Online        20 GB      0 B        '''*'''
  Disk 1    Online       300 GB      0 B
 
 DISKPART>

Note: If you receive the error; "The disk management services could not complete the operation.," the Virtual Disk Service is probably disabled. Set the service to start manually and try again.
