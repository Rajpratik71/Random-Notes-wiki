Fiber Optic Cables:

Consists of Glass core, Glass Cladding and coating

Multimode (MMF) - 50 or 62.5 micron, short wavelength (850 nm), Modal Dispersion

Single mode (SMF) - 9 micron, long wavelength (1310 nm), chromatic dispersion

Cores can decouple from ferrule. Air gaps can result in an 80% loss in signal strength.

Glossary:

ELWL - Extended Long Wave Length (1310 nm)

LC - Lucent Connector (Typically 2 Gbps or higher) Take great care to protecct ferrules

LWL - Long Wave Length (1310 nm)

OM - Optical Modes, OM1 (Orange) 62.5 micron, OM2 (Orange) 50 micron core, OM3 (Aqua) 50 micron core. OS1 SMF (Blue)

SC - Siemens Connector (Typically 1 Gbps)

SFP - Small Form-factor Pluggable

SWL - Short Wave Length (850 nm)

XFP - Small Form-factor Pluggable for 10 Gbps
