== Logical Disk: Ave Disk Queue Length ==
Add 2 to the number of Spindles present for an acceptable average. 1 Spindle + 2 = 3. A value above this calculation indicates a bottleneck with the hard disk.


== Processor: % Processor Time ==
Values up to 85% are considered acceptable.


== Memory: Pages/sec ==
An average value of around 6 is considered acceptable. The acceptable threshold can vary substantially depending on computer hardware, but a value of greater than 20 can indicate the need for more RAM.


== Network Interface: Bytes Total/sec ==
Determine % of totally bandwidth available.
