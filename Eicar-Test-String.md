The Eicar Test String is a string used to testing antivirus software. This is not a real virus and is only used for testing purposes by the antivirus software. This string can be simply be inserted into any file for testing detection. By default, the file name is Eicar.com, but it could be renamed to anything.

The line below is the test string, but with a space inserted between the $ and EICAR. This should be one continuous string without spaces so be sure to remove this space before testing. This is just to prevent any accidental detection here or after storing locally.
